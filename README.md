# Web3 Impact Work

Web3_ImpactWork is a collaborative repository advancing impact measurement and management for Web3 ecosystems. It brings together open frameworks, tools, datasets, and case studies to help decentralised projects design for, measure, and govern real-world impact.

The repository focuses on verifiable environmental, social, economic, and governance (ESEG) outcomes, supporting SDG-aligned blockchain innovation through transparent methodologies, reproducible metrics, and open-source collaboration. It is intended for builders, researchers, funders, and institutions seeking to move beyond narratives toward credible, accountable impact practice in decentralised systems.

## Start here

If you are new to this repository, begin with the following core resources:

1. **Impact Framework (Markdown)**  
   The core methodology for measuring and governing ESEG outcomes in Web3 projects.  
   → `/docs/ETHxUN_ImpactFramework.md`

2. **Guideline: Synthesis of Findings**  
   Practical guidance translating the framework into project-level decision-making.  
   → `/docs/Guideline_Synthesis.md`

3. **Case Studies**  
   Applied examples showing how impact measurement works in real decentralised contexts.  
   → `/case-studies/`

4. **Impact Mapping Dataset (CSV)**  
   Structured data supporting comparative analysis and reuse.  
   → `/data/impact_mapping.csv`

## Release status

This repository is currently at **v1.0**, representing the first stable public release of the Web3_ImpactWork frameworks and resources.

v1.0 is intended as a reference implementation for Web3 public goods and impact-oriented projects. It prioritises methodological transparency, ethical reuse, and adaptability over prescriptive standardisation.

For full release context and scope, see:
→ GitHub Releases: Web3_ImpactWork v1.0

## Repository structure

- `/docs` – Canonical frameworks and methodological documents (Markdown)
- `/reports` – Versioned PDF exports for citation and offline use
- `/case-studies` – Applied impact stories and field examples
- `/data` – Datasets supporting impact analysis

## Document formats

To support clarity and long-term reuse:

- **Markdown (.md)** files are the canonical, living versions of frameworks and guidelines.
- **PDF** files are frozen, citable snapshots of released materials.
- **CSV** files provide open datasets for analysis and reuse.

Where multiple formats exist, the Markdown version should be treated as the source of truth.

## Scope and limitations

The frameworks and tools in this repository are designed to support rigorous thinking and practice around impact in decentralised systems. They do not provide automated impact guarantees, universal scoring systems, or definitive valuations of social outcomes.

Impact assessment is inherently contextual and political. These resources aim to strengthen accountability, learning, and governance, not replace community judgment, lived experience, or ethical deliberation.
