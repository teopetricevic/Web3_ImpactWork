Blockchain for Fiscal Transparency;Guinea-Bissau, a small nation on the coast of West Africa, has made a quantum leap into the future. In May 2024, the country successfully launched a blockchain platform—as part of the country’s program with the IMF, under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)—designed to revolutionize its public wage bill management. Following four years collaborating with the Fund and technological advisor Ernst & Young, and with financial support from selected partners, Guinea-Bissau is moving ahead with implementing this new technology. This initiative, one of the first of its type for Africa, marks a significant leap toward better governance and transparency in government finances.

Building Blocks - Beneficiary-centric, blockchain-based network for inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance ;Building Blocks (BB) is a blockchain network optimized for humanitarian and development use cases. BB is designed for inter-organizational collaboration, coordination and preventative de-duplication to optimize and harmonize assistance by providing a 360° view of which agency is reaching which recipients and with what assistance, ensuring collective assistance is coordinated and equitable, and access to support is also simplified and more convenient.;WFP;"Financial inclusion and digital payments

On top of the BB blockchain network, various applications or ‘smart contracts’ of interest to the humanitarian community can be built, made available for free to all network members. Network member WFP has developed a robust and powerful financial value transfer application that facilitates the transfer of value which can be saved, traded and/or consumed, such as food, cash, WASH, medicine and more. New applications optimized for other use cases, for example the transfer of value through information such as Digital ID and Supply Chain, could also be deployed by network members.";WFP & third party developer partnerships;Tokens for aid distribution (blchn-based);"Private, permissioned EVM; participation through engagement as a BB network member under a governance framework.

Alternative route in some operations, BB is made available as a free-of-charge service to the humanitarian community through participation in Cash Working Group (CWG), Food Security & Livelihoods (FSL) and other clusters. ";For transaction throughput, cost, and privacy reasons, BB runs on a private-permissioned blockchain, enabling an increase in transaction throughput beyond current and anticipated near future needs, on-chain transaction cost of zero, block (confirmation) time of 5 seconds, and the information on BB to only be visible to its approved humanitarian members. ;"No, BB is currently not open source though built on many open-source components.

All smart contracts on BB are available for free to other full BB network members.";SDG 17;SDG 17.6, 17.7, 17.16, 17.17;"Supporting >4.92 million households affected by conflict in Ukraine since May 2022. ​

Etherisc – Blockchain-Based Insurance for Smallholder Farmers ;Etherisc is a blockchain-based technology platform which allows end-to-end automation of parametric insurance products. The platform produces a single source of real-time claims data while removing the need for each stakeholder to separately verify weather data before claims are paid out. This automation enables claims to be paid faster while cutting costs. Leveraging blockchain's real-time transaction tracking also enhances transparent monitoring for all stakeholders;WFP;"Financial inclusion and digital payments
